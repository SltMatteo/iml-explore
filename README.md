This is a project I did for the 2023 Intro to ML course at EPFL. It had 2 milestones which are both included here.  
It contains the following models:  
-linear regressor  
-logistic regressor  
-knn  
-cnn 
-mlp   

we used the [Stanford Dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) and [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist) datasets.
