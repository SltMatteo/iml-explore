This is a project I did for the 2023-2024 edition of the Intro to ML course at EPFL. It had 2 milestones which are both included here.  
It contains the following models:

- linear regressor  
- logistic regressor  
- knn  
- cnn  
- mlp
- vision transformer


We used the [Stanford Dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) and [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist) dataset.
The models average 80 to 90% precision.
